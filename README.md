# Final Project

For this application I decided to go with a dynamic web app powered by the MERN tech stack. MERN is made up of MongoDB, Express JS, React JS, and Node JS. The application is a 3-tier application where the presentation tier is a React JS frontend, the application tier is the Express JS backend, which is itself on top of Node JS, and the data tier is a MongoDB database. All 3 tiers each have their own service via docker-compose. The backend uses port 9000, the database uses port 27017, and the frontend uses port 3000.

## Running the App Locally
The following commands are applicable to Windows PowerShell terminal

After cloning the repo and navigating to the project's root folder, run the docker-compose using:
```
docker-compose up
```
Once all 3 containers are running you can navigate to localhost:3000 to see the React frontend.

## Unfinished Status
The project's current state does not function as a 3-tier app as originally intended. Currently the application only contains information from the frontend React app and the backend Express JS app. The Express JS app was originally configured to be the frontend and so as a consequence, the docker-compose app looks like this:

"This is a paragraph in the app header" and "This is a pragraph in the app body" are generated by the React application. The Express JS app generates the html tags in a paragraph. When using the dockerfile in the /backend directory, the Express JS app looks like this:

The MongoDB service is running and listens on port 27017 but the Express JS app makes no attempt to query it.
